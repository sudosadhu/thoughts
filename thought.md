tLonging for a melody to be born, a song trapped within the chambers of the heart, yearning for release.
Two souls, unknowingly dancing in same rhythm, both longine for the same melody a duet played only in the heart ,dancing on the edge of a cliff, afraid to take that leap of faith.
A silent symphony of unspoken words, a duet played only in the heart.
Two souls, dancing on the edge of a cliff, afraid to take that leap of faith.


Two souls, dancing to the same rhythm, yearning for a duet.Yet, they stand frozen on the precipice of a cliff, afraid to take that leap of faith.
