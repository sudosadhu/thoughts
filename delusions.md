# But is this true

no this is not the truth, yes maybe by practicisng and focusing i might have achieved a little mastery over the apin , amastery over the technique and something else , but the desire to be superhuman is because fo the failures tha t i have endured in the life and failure in plaing and real game which i am scared of now playing because of the pain of losing the mind creates illusions making us think we are superhuman  and something like that , this illusions make your delusional stupid, wrong doing and everything else ,  we have to overcome these and get away from the pain and delusions,
